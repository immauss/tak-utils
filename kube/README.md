ToDos:
- how to get CoreConfig consistent and into container
- update Coreconfig to point to actual database
- get it to actually run
- move the admin.loaded to /opt/tak/certs/files - This make the fact that the admin cert is loaded in the DB persistent . . .
- CA_NAME, used in the start script for cert generation, should be an environment variable.
- remove bits from deployment not needed
  - Password - This is getting pulled from CoreConfig in both contianers. No need for secret mgmt.
  - ??
- Fix load balancer so that ports are exposed correctly. (not the nodeport)
- Get datbase to replicate to other nodes ... run in master/slave ... with 3 replicas. 
- Why is start-db.sh so wonky .... wtf while true; do .... 
  - This and the 3 scripts it calls need to be optimized. It's a Freaking mess in there.
- takserver should be doing a pg_isready call to wait for the DB. 
- Need to add the following to configs. 
  - CoreConfig.example.xml   
  - UserAuthenticationFile.xml
  - CoreConfig.xml          
  - TAKIgniteConfig.xml          
  - logging-restrictsize.xml
- Concern for multiple containers writing to xml files and causing corruption. 
  - No multiple replicas until this is resolve/answered.
- Configs. 
  - some don't exist at starup ... the userauth.xml  (or whatever it si named) so need to create it in configs and link back to /opt/taks
